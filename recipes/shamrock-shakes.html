    <p>
        This creamy Shamrock Shake is a blend of vanilla ice cream, milk, mint extract, and green food coloring for a fun St. 
        Patrick's Day treat. 
        This recipe has become a tradition in our house. The kids love it, and so do I!

    <ul>
        <li>Ice cream and milk: Like many milkshakes, this Shamrock Shake starts with vanilla ice cream and milk.</li>
        <li>Mint extract: Mint extract gives the shake its signature minty freshness. It packs a powerful punch, so use the extract sparingly.</li>
        <li>Food coloring: About nine drops of green food coloring will dye your milkshake a gorgeous emerald hue.</li>
        <li>Chocolate syrup: Drizzle chocolate syrup inside the glass for an impressive presentation.</li>
        <li>Whipped cream: Top the Shamrock Shake with store-bought or homemade whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Decorating sugar: A sprinkle of green decorating sugar is the perfect finishing touch.</li>
    </ul>
